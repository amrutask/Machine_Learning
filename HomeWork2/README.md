* Implemented four different models in keras for image classification task using cifar10 image dataset and checked their performance on validation data.

* Every model is diffent in terms of number of Conv2D layers, Pooling layers, and number of fully connected.

* Data augmentation is used for image flipping, rotation, shifting and zooming.

* Forth model has highest accuracy hence the final model(CNN_final.ipynb) is developed using the fourth model with k-fold validation.
The final model tests the performance of the same model on test data.
