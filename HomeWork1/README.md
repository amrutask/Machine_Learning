## Problem 1:
Logistic regression with mean squared error loss and mini batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset.

## Problem 2
Logistic regression with binary cross entropy loss and mini batch gradient descent algorithm on MNIST dataset.

## Problem 3
Multiclass classification using softmax and categorical cross entropy loss on MNIST dataset.

## Problem 4
Classification of MNIST digits using softmax in keras.

## Problem 5
Adding extra 4 features along with the main image features of size 28*28.
1. Number of white regions. For instance, a typical 0 has 2 white regions and 8 has 3.
2. The actual height of the digits in 28*28 frame.
3. The actual width of the digits in 28*28 frame.
4. Even or odd (0,2,4... are even , whereas 1,3,5,.. are odd)
