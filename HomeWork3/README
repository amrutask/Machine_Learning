## Description
The goal of this homework is to learn how to leverage pretrained convnets(VGG19) and to use visualization techniques. 

## Dataset: 
cats vs dogs from https://storage.googleapis.com/mledu-datasets/cats_and_dogs_filtered.zip

#### Problem1:
Feature extraction with data augmentation.

#### Problem2: 
Fine-tuning with data augmentation.

#### Problem3: 
Visualization of heatmaps of class activation for the the model obtained in Problem 2.

#### Problem4:
Activation model that takes as input an image and produces as output the activation of the last conv layer of the model obtained in Problem 2.
t-SNE visualization on activations of the validation images to see how well the convnet separates cats from dogs.
